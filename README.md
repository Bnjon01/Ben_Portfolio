# Benjamin Jones: Portfolio
A visual portfolio of my works

# Project 1: DeepPacketNN
- Implementated and reported on the novel solution to encrypted packet traffic classification kit, Deep Packet, by Lotfollahi et al. (2019)
- Classifies encrypted traffic by its traffic type or by its application of origin with between 94-98% Precision and Recall.
- Uses rigorous preprocessing methods and a combination of a Stacked Autoencoder and a One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network.
- Written in Python 3 and uses the Keras front end with TensorFlow backend for the Nueral Network architectures along with Pandas, Numpy, SciKit, Binascii, and csv.
