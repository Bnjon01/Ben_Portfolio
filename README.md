# Benjamin Jones: Portfolio
A portfolio of my various personal and University projects


# [Project 1: DeepPacket Neural Network](https://github.com/Bnjon01/DeepPacketNN)
- Implementated and reported on the novel solution to encrypted packet traffic classification kit, Deep Packet, by Lotfollahi et al. (2019)
- Classifies encrypted traffic by its traffic type or by its application of origin with between 94-98% Precision and Recall.
- Uses rigorous preprocessing methods and a combination of a Stacked Autoencoder and a One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network.
- Written in Python 3 and uses the Keras front end with TensorFlow backend for the Nueral Network architectures along with Pandas, Numpy, SciKit, Binascii, and csv.

# [Project 2: SSL Certificate classification](https://github.com/Bnjon01/ML_SSL_Cert_Analysis)
- Predicts if a website is malicious or not based on its SSL certificate
- Uses one of three Machine Learning classification models to predicts whether or not a website harbours malicious content.
- The model correctly predicts with up to almost 98% accuracy of the SSL certificates as belonging to either malicious or benign websites.
- Written in Python 3 and uses Pandas, Numpy, and SciKit.
